## Apiato Postman API & Environment {#apiato-postman-api--environment}

If you use Postman to build and explore your API's you will find this predefined Apiato Postman collection a great
start to your new Apiato project. Simply download both the Environment and Collection to Postman to get started.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

#### Configure Apiato

It's important that you run the following shell commands to migrate and seed your database. The next command configures
a Laravel Passport client. Finally, you need to run the last command to grant the Admin user with full permission to
access all routes.

```bash
php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
php artisan passport:client --password
php artisan apiato:permissions:toRole admin
```

Be sure to copy and paste your new `client_id` and `client_secret` into the `.env` file. Like so...

```bash
CLIENT_WEB_ADMIN_ID={CLIENT_ID}
CLIENT_WEB_ADMIN_SECRET={CLIENT_SECRET}

CLIENT_MOBILE_ADMIN_ID={CLIENT_ID}
CLIENT_MOBILE_ADMIN_SECRET={CLIENT_SECRET}
```

The above steps will ensure you have a functioning Apiato API environment to explore with Postman.

#### Download & Install Postman

Visit the Postman website and download the application.

### Add Apiato Environment & Collection to Postman {#add-apiato-environment--collection-to-postman}

[Download Apiato Environment & Collection](../assets/files/Apiato_API.postman.zip)

Steps
* Open Postman
* Click on "**import**" button **top left** of Postman application.
* Click on "**Choose files**". Select both the Environment and Collection JSON files and click add.
* Select "**Apiato Environment**" from the Environment dropdown list on the **top right** of the Postman Application.

### Using the Postman Apiato API Collection {#using-the-postman-apiato-api-collection}

The first thing you need to do to use the Apiato endpoints is to log in to your Apiato API.

* Select the **Apiato API Collection** in the left menu.
* Select **Authentication** folder.
* Select **Login** endpoint.
* Click **Send** button.

The response will return a body with the API access token. Normally you would have to manually add this in a header
with each request using `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN`. This however is automatically done for you.

From this point you can now access all endpoints using the **Super Admin** role.

If you would like to test logging into your application with different users then switch to the `body` tab on the
`login` endpoint and update the credentials.

```json
{
	"email": "admin@admin.com",
	"password": "admin"
}
```
